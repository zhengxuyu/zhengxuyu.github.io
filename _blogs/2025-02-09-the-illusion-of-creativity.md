Throughout history, creativity has been regarded as one of humanity's most defining traits. We build economies around it, award Nobel Prizes for it, and tell our children it is what separates us from machines. The "creative genius" — da Vinci sketching flying machines, Einstein reimagining spacetime, Jobs unveiling the iPhone — sits at the apex of our cultural mythology.

But what if creativity, as we understand it, does not actually exist?

Here is a claim that sounds extreme but is, on inspection, defensible from first principles: **what we call "creativity" is nothing more than the recombination of historical experience — individual and evolutionary — perturbed by noise and filtered by selection.** There is no magical spark. There is no special faculty. There is experience in, recombination in the middle, and output at the end. The word "creativity" is just a label we slap on the result when we find it impressive.

## First: creativity is not imagination

Before going further, it is worth drawing a line that most people blur.

**Imagination** is the ability to construct mental representations that are not directly present in perception — to picture a purple elephant, to simulate a conversation that hasn't happened, to mentally rotate a 3D object. This is a real, measurable cognitive capacity. It operates on internal models and is grounded in specific neural mechanisms. The existence of imagination is not in dispute.

**Creativity** is a much stronger claim. It says that humans can generate genuinely _novel_ outputs — things that are not reducible to transformations of prior inputs. It says there is something happening beyond recombination, some spark or faculty that produces true novelty from within.

Imagination is the machinery. "Creativity" is the myth we've built around what the machinery produces.

The quarrel is not with the machinery. The argument is that the machinery is _sufficient_ — and that the myth is explanatorily empty. Everything imagination produces can be fully accounted for as recombination of experience under noise. No additional entity called "creativity" is needed.

With that distinction in place, here is why.

## Every "creation" has a parts list

Pick any celebrated creative achievement and trace its components. They all predate the achievement.

Picasso's Cubism came from African masks he saw at a museum, Cézanne's geometric style, and Iberian sculpture. Darwin built natural selection from Malthus's population theory, geological gradualism, and his own field notes. The iPhone combined touchscreens, mobile chips, and graphical interfaces that had existed for years or decades.

This is not cherry-picking. It works for every example. The "creative act" is always an assembly of pre-existing parts. If you can always find the parts list, then what exactly is "creativity" adding? The answer, most likely, is nothing. It is just a word for a recombination we happen to admire.

## "But why are some people more creative than others?"

If creativity is just recombination, why doesn't everyone produce masterpieces?

Because the system is chaotic. Three factors are enough to explain the divergence:

**Different inputs.** No two people absorb the same information in the same order, at the same time, in the same emotional state. Two readers can pick up the same book and internalize completely different things depending on when and how they read it.

**Noise.** Neural activity is inherently noisy. Synapses are probabilistic. The exact chain of associations the brain fires when thinking about a problem is never the same twice. This is physics, not inspiration.

**Feedback loops.** One encouraging teacher, one lucky break, one audience that laughs at the right moment — these small events redirect entire trajectories. Remove any one of them, and the "genius" may never have gone down that path.

No two snowflakes look the same either. We don't call snowflakes creative. Complexity and uniqueness come from chaotic dynamics, not from a special generative faculty.

## The brain's architecture doesn't save the argument

A smarter objection: "OK, the raw materials come from experience. But the brain's ability to draw analogies, form abstractions, and make unexpected connections — that's creativity."

But where did those abilities come from? They were shaped by natural selection over millions of years. They are the species' accumulated survival strategies, baked into neural wiring.

Analogical reasoning exists because recognizing "this situation is like that dangerous situation" kept our ancestors alive. Abstraction exists because compressing complex inputs into simple categories saves cognitive energy. Associative thinking exists because tracking patterns helps predict what happens next.

These are powerful tools. But they are functional adaptations, like opposable thumbs or binocular vision. Calling them "creativity" is just renaming an evolved processing pipeline. It doesn't explain anything new.

## There was no "first creation"

The usual reductio: if creativity is just recombination, who made the first tool? There was nothing to recombine.

This assumes the first tool appeared as a discrete event. It didn't.

Chimpanzees already use stones to crack nuts. Capuchin monkeys strike rocks together and produce sharp flakes. The oldest human stone tools are so crude they're barely distinguishable from naturally broken rocks. The transition from accidental striking to intentional tool-making took hundreds of thousands of years.

What happened was simple: an individual hit a rock, got a sharp edge by accident, used it, got a food reward, repeated the behavior. Operant conditioning, social learning, and selection did the rest over deep time. This is the same variation-plus-selection mechanism that produced every biological adaptation. We don't say the eye was "created." The same logic applies to the first tool.

## AI proves the point

This is where the argument becomes hard to escape.

Large language models write poetry, generate art, compose music, and produce scientific hypotheses. Human evaluators regularly judge these outputs as "creative." But we know exactly how these systems work: they recombine patterns from training data using random sampling, guided by optimization objectives.

There is no creativity module inside GPT. There is no hidden spark. There is recombination under noise. And the outputs are indistinguishable from what humans call "creative."

If a system built entirely on recombination can produce everything we associate with creativity, the simplest conclusion is that human creativity works the same way. Not that the machine somehow acquired a soul, but that we never had a magical faculty to begin with. We were always doing what the machine does — just on biological hardware.

## What's left after removing "creativity"?

Four things, and they explain everything:

1. **Historical experience** as input — everything a person has ever seen, read, heard, felt, plus everything evolution encoded in the brain.
2. **Evolved neural architecture** as the processing engine — the imagination machinery: analogy, abstraction, association.
3. **Stochastic noise** as the source of variation — the randomness that makes each recombination different.
4. **Selection** as the filter — the environment, the audience, the market, the peer reviewers that decide which outputs get labeled "creative."

That's the complete model. Every instance of "creativity" fits within it. Adding a fifth element called "creativity" increases complexity without explaining anything new. Occam's razor says: cut it.

## The bottom line

"Creativity" is not a cause. It is a label. It is what we call the output when recombination produces something we didn't expect and happen to value.

An infant raised in total isolation produces nothing — not because she lacks creativity, but because she has no experience to recombine. A genius surrounded by rich inputs produces extraordinary things — not because he has a special faculty, but because he has more material, more feedback, and more lucky breaks in the chaotic dynamics of recombination.

Imagination is real. The processing is real. The outputs are real and often extraordinary. But "creativity" as a distinct force beyond the machinery? That is the part we invented. And it is the part we don't need.

## MEMO

> 人类不具备超越因果链的"创造力"。一切所谓创造，本质上是主体对历史经验（含个体经验与物种经验）在随机扰动下的重构，经由环境选择后被事后追认为"创造"。

Humans do not possess any form of "creativity" that transcends the causal chain. All so-called creation is, in essence, the subject's recombination of historical experience — encompassing both individual lived experience and species-level evolutionary experience — perturbed by stochastic noise, filtered through environmental selection, and retroactively labeled as "creativity."
