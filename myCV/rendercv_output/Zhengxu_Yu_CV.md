# Intro

I am currently a AI Algorithm Expert at Alibaba Group. I obtained my Ph.D. from Zhejiang University in 2021, advised by Prof. Deng Cai and Prof. Xiaofei He. Previously, I obtained my Master’s degree from University of Surrey, advised by Prof. H Lilian Tang.

My research interests focus on Reinforcement Learning, Large language Model, Computer Vision to achieving embodied AGI. My current research goal is to exploring LLM reasoning capability and forming LLM agent to solve general real-world tasks.

Previously, I has published eleven papers on top-tier peer-reviewed Artificial Intelligence international conferences and journals.
