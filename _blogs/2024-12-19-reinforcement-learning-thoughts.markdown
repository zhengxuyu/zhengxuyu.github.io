## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown tremendous potential in various domains, and urban applications are no exception. In this post, I'll share some thoughts on applying RL to urban traffic control and city management.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Multi-Agent Coordination
Urban environments are inherently multi-agent systems where multiple entities (traffic lights, vehicles, pedestrians) need to coordinate effectively.

### 2. Scalability
Real-world urban systems are massive, requiring efficient algorithms that can handle large-scale optimization problems.

### 3. Safety and Reliability
Urban applications demand high safety standards, making exploration in RL particularly challenging.

## Current Research Directions

My research focuses on:
- **Stable Learning**: Ensuring consistent performance across different scenarios
- **Causal Learning**: Understanding the underlying mechanisms of urban dynamics
- **Multi-agent Communication**: Enabling effective coordination between agents

## Future Outlook

The integration of RL with urban systems holds great promise for creating smarter, more efficient cities. However, significant challenges remain in terms of deployment, safety, and scalability.
